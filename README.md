# Personal Website

This repository contains my personal website with static PCR (Put-Call Ratio) analysis snapshots.

## Snapshot Files

The website displays pre-generated static snapshot files:
- `latest_table.json` - All analysis tables and data
- `latest_plot_pcr.png` - PCR by expiry plot
- `latest_plot_impulse.png` - Hedging impulse timeline
- `latest_plot_eventscore.png` - Event score timeline

## Files Structure

All files are in the root directory (flat structure) for GitHub Pages compatibility.
